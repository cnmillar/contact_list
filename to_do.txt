Last thing that I did: 
- Added phone and connection classes. 
- Can successfully add to phones table in database.


To do:
(1) Add update functionality
(2) Confirm that the cascade delete works when contact_id is deleted
(3) Make sure that all the finds show the phone numbers. How should we deal with multiple phone numbers?
